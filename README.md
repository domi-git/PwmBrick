# PwmBrick

The aim of the project is to create little Box to control a DC-Motor. The power should come from a 18650 LiIon-Cell and the form-factor should be small.

**This is not a finished product! If you use anything from the project, you use it at your own risk! Be espacially careful with the handling of LiIon-Batteries. If you don't know what you're doing there is always the risk of a thermal runaway which could lead to a fire or an explosion!**

## Mechanics

This is the most important part and dictates the available space for the electronics and the position of a lot of elements on the pcb, like LEDs, Buttons and connectors.

If you look from the top onto the device it looks like this:
