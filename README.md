# PwmBrick

The aim of the project is to create a little Box to control a DC-Motor. The power should come from a 18650 LiIon-Cell and the form-factor should be small.

**This is not a finished product! If you use anything from the project, you use it at your own risk! Be espacially careful with the handling of LiIon-Batteries. If you don't know what you're doing there is always the risk of a thermal runaway which could lead to a fire or an explosion!**

## Design Idea

The mechanics are the most important part and dictate the available space for the electronics and the position of a lot of elements on the pcb, like LEDs, buttons and connectors.

If you look from the top onto the device the design idea is as follows:

## Mechanics

All the CAD-Drawings were carried out with Blender. To get an idea of the housing and how the brick really looks, i rendered the following images:

## Electronics

Everything was done in KiCad. The goal was to keep the overall space of the electronics very close to the footprint of the battery-holder for the 18650 LiIon cell. The Layouts for top and bottom are as follows:

## toDos / improvements

### Documentation

* Expand the mechanics section. Important aspects are the snap-fit solution, assembly and 3D-printing.
* Software documentation?
* Section about product development. Why this kind of sulotion?
* Fill in the toDos for mechanics, electronics and software
