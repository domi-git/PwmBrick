Charging process from minimum Voltage (UVLO defined in the software) to the maximum voltage (defined via the MAX1811-IC to 4.2V)

Conditions:
-----------
- UVLO in the Software (going into UVLO): 3,40V
- UVLO in the Software (leaving UVLO): 3,60V
- Measured Battery-Voltage at going into UVLO: 3,60V

Charging Process:
-----------------
- 40 Minutes until UVLO was left (approx. 3.7 volts)
- 3h until battery was fully charged (MAX1811 stopped charging)
