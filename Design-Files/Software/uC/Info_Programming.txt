The controller can be programmed via ST-Link/V2-1. You can use most of the nucleo boards from ST for programming, because they have an integreted programmer (i have the Nucleo-F446RE-Board).

Connection between Nucleo-Board and own PCB
-------------------------------------------
I'm using connector CN4 on the Nucleo-Board, with the following pins:
- VDD
- SWCLK
- GND
- SWDIO
- NRST

You can flash the software with the STM32CubeIDE (just press the "debug"-button).
